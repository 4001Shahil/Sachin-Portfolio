INSTRUCTIONS TO ADD YOUR PROFILE PHOTO:
==========================================

1. Save your profile photo as: profile.jpg
2. Place it in this folder: c:\Users\hp\OneDrive\Desktop\Sachin Portfolio\public\
3. The photo should be named exactly: profile.jpg

Your portfolio is already configured to display the photo at /profile.jpg

Alternative: You can also save it as profile.png and update the reference in:
- src/components/Hero.jsx (change /profile.jpg to /profile.png)

The photo will automatically appear in the Hero section with a beautiful glowing animation!
